For security reasons, some of the Firebase code was deleted from this repo. You can still run the app locally using Android Studio. Pull this repo and open this folder in Android Studio.
To add the firebase code. Create a Firebase project. Update the firebaseApi file with your credentials. You must create your own realtime data base in firebase
